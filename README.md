This repository contains a web scraping script developed as part of a research effort with Professors Caroline Theoharides (Amherst College) and Susan Godlonton (Williams College). The project focuses on mapping the development of reproductive health behaviors and local government policies in the Philippines.

Due to the fragmented digital infrastructure in the Philippines, where there is no centralized repository for ordinances and policies, our initial methodology involves gathering and analyzing news articles to build a foundational dataset.

## Current Workflow
1. **Challenge**: Lack of centralized resources in the Philippines for accessing government ordinances and policies. Reliance on news articles as an alternative source to track policy developments.
2. **Solution**: This script gathers relevant news articles based on predefined keywords.
3. **Outcome**: A dataset of news articles organized by region and topics to serve as the basis for deeper analysis in subsequent project phases.

## Future Plans
This repository is the first step in a broader research project. Future updates will include:
1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Topic modeling to identify policy trends and media framing. Sentiment analysis to assess public opinion on reproductive health policies.
2. **Data Integration**: Cross-referencing news articles with official documents (if available).
3. **Data Visualization**: Interactive maps and visualizations of policy developments by region.
4. **Policy Mapping**: A comprehensive analysis of how local government policies influence migration and reproductive health behaviors.
